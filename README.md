# Deep-Learning-with-Keras-Tensorflow

This repository contains a collection of practical notebooks and resources for learning and applying deep learning techniques using Keras and TensorFlow. The materials are designed to help users develop hands-on skills in building, training, and evaluating neural networks for a variety of machine learning tasks.

## Overview

The repository covers a range of essential deep learning topics, including:

- **Keras Functional API:**  
  Learn how to implement complex neural network architectures using Keras's Functional API, enabling the construction of models with multiple inputs, outputs, and non-linear topology.

- **Transfer Learning:**  
  Explore the use of pre-trained models and transfer learning techniques to leverage existing knowledge for new tasks, accelerating training and improving performance on limited data.

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**  
  Gain practical experience in building and training GANs using Keras, including understanding generator and discriminator models, loss functions, and performance evaluation through both visual inspection and quantitative metrics.

- **Advanced Transformers:**  
  Delve into transformer architectures, which are foundational for state-of-the-art results in natural language processing and many other domains. Learn about attention mechanisms, encoder-decoder structures, and their implementation in Keras.
